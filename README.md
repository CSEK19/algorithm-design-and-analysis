# CSS 549 Algorithm Analysis and Design


## Course Overview

This repository contains all the materials, assignments, and projects for the CSS 549 Algorithm Analysis and Design course in Winter 2024. The course covers fundamental techniques for algorithm design and analysis, such as computational complexity, greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, randomized algorithms, and computational intractability. 

<!-- ## Topics Covered -->

<!-- - **Computational Complexity**: Understanding the efficiency of algorithms.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler steps.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms for processing data structures that can be visualized as nodes with edges between them. -->
<!-- - **Randomized Algorithms**: Algorithms that employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic.
- **Computational Intractability**: Understanding problems for which no efficient solution can be found. -->
