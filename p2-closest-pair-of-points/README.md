# Closest Pair of Points Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements the Closest Pair of Points algorithm in C++. The algorithm finds the smallest distance between a pair of two (2) different points in the plane, and it runs in O(n log n) time.

## Input Format
The input data is read from a file named `program2data.txt`. The file is formatted as follows:

- Line 1: Number of points (n)
- Lines 2 to n+1: x- and y-coordinates of the points (real numbers)

## Output
The output will be the smallest distance between a pair of two (2) different points. The distance between the closest pair of points in every recursive call (including the overall solution) will be output to the console.

## How to Run

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the program with `program2data.txt` in the same directory.
